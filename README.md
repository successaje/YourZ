YourZ ðŸŒŸ
Tokenize Your Words, Own Your Influence
YourZ is a next-generation blogging platform built on Zora Protocol, where every post becomes a collectible NFT. Writers monetize their content directly, and readers invest in ideas by owning tokenized postsâ€”earning royalties when others discover and collect them.

âœ¨ Key Features
1. Tokenized Blog Posts
Every article is minted as an ERC-721 NFT (Zora Protocol).

Set your own mint price & royalties (e.g., 10% on resales).

Posts are stored permanently on IPFS (decentralized storage).

2. Invest in Content You Love
Readers collect posts like digital assets.

Earn passive income from secondary sales (royalty shares).

Trade valuable posts like NFT trading cards.

3. Collaborative Writing
Co-author posts with revenue splits (Zoraâ€™s SplitMain).

Multi-signature publishing for teams.

4. Web3-Native Experience
No emails/passwordsâ€”sign in with your Ethereum wallet (MetaMask, Rainbow, etc.).

ENS integration (yourname.eth as your identity).

Token-gated discussions (only NFT holders can comment).

5. Creator & Supporter Dashboard
Track earnings from primary sales & royalties.

See which posts are trending.

Manage collaborations & splits.
